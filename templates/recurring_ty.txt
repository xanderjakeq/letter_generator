Dear [first_names],

On behalf of everyone at Joe’s Movement Emporium, I want to thank you for your
generous recurring donations received in [year] to support our approved
Community Investment Tax Credit project: Keep Creative Suitland Going Strong.
Your total amount donated in [year] is [donation_total]. Your contributions have been as follows:

[donation-1]               [donation-7]
[donation-2]               [donation-8]
[donation-3]               [donation-9]

*You should retain this letter in your records for tax purposes. As you may be aware, the IRS no longer accepts only a canceled check to substantiate a charitable contribution of $250 or more. This letter further verifies that the items you received in exchange for your donation were insubstantial under IRS guidelines. Therefore, the entire amount of your gift is eligible for a 50% Maryland State tax credit through the Community Investment Tax Credit program.*




Yours truly,
